# Linear Regression 

## Overview
This project is part of the CSC312 Machine Learning course. It explores both univariate and multivariate linear regression techniques to analyze and predict data trends, such as profits based on temperature or other features.

## Features
- Implementation of univariate and multivariate linear regression.
- Gradient descent for parameter optimization.
- Visualization of cost function convergence.
- Predictions using trained models.

## Instructions
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the `.ipynb` file using Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
3. Run each cell sequentially to execute the code and observe the results.

## Contents
- `data1.csv`: Dataset for univariate linear regression.
- `data2.csv`: Dataset for multivariate linear regression.
- `Linear_Regression.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the implementation.

## How to Run
1. Install [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/install) or use [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
2. Open the `Linear_Regression.ipynb` file.
3. Ensure the `data1.csv` and `data2.csv` files are in the same directory.
4. Execute all cells in order.

## Learning Outcomes
This assignment covers:
- Understanding the cost function for linear regression.
- Implementing gradient descent iteratively and using matrix operations.
- Using Python libraries such as NumPy and Matplotlib for computation and visualization.
- Applying regression techniques to real-world datasets.
